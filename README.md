## Welcome to the dragon book club study guide.

This is a difficult book, and would be very difficult to tackle without supporting material and copius amounts of examples, so the plan is to use this repo to share links, notes, and example code.

### Structure
It is organized into folders for each chapter. Each folder will have a readme for our shared notes for now. We'll add more orginazation after that point as needed.
